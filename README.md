# Introduction
This work was done to study the diffusion in the dynamics of particle beams in accelerator
physics. The phenomenon can be described by the HÃ©non map whose linear frequency is
stochastically perturbed. Finally, a theoretical model for the action diffusion based on the
Fokker-Planck equation is introduced and its solution agrees with the simulation process.

All scripts need to be compiled with the "-std=c++11" flag, also the optional flag "-fopenmp" to use OpenMP and/or "-O3" for optimization.
The main part of the code was also integrated in Python 3+ using Cython. A python script "ensemble_setup.py" is available to install the package.

The diffusion coefficients values are computed using "henon_find_coeff_diffusion.cpp". 
These values are used by "henon_diffusion_cranknicolson.cpp".
Finally "henon_diffusion_cranknicolson.cpp" and "henon_noise_diffusion.cpp" results can be compared.
